# BCG-s-Data-Science-Advanced-Analytics-Experience
I present here the project of my Boston Consulting Group’s Data Science & Advanced Analytics Virtual Experience (10-4-2023 to 10-8-2023). The issue is about a typical binary classification problem: the abandonment or permanence of the customers of a service provider. However, thanks to it I learned new abilities, above all in the EDA step. I enjoyed a lot working on this project.
I had to split the document in two parts –EDA and Feature Engineering & Data modeling–because otherwise it would have been very long.
Please, in case you read it tell me what you think about it and criticize me. It’s sure it contains errors but these are normal on a learning path like the one I find.
I’ll be on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jose-alberto-camacho-lopez/
